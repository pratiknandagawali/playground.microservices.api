# Playground.microservices.api notes

#### This API is created as a sample template that can be used for building a microservice. The template is empowered with modularity, clean code, scalable design patterns like MediatR using CQRS, Dependency Injection, Pollycircuit for making the APIs more resilent and SOLID principles.
#### Commited with the initial ToDo repository for unleasing the power of Object relational Mapping(ORM). 
#### Powered with swagger as an Open API documentation.

## Microservice Architecture

### A microservice architecture – a variant of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) structural style – arranges an application as a collection of loosely-coupled services. In a microservices architecture, services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight.

## Benefits

### The benefit of decomposing an application into different smaller services are numerous:

#### Modularity: This makes the application easier to understand, develop, test, and become more resilient to architecture erosion.This benefit is often argued in comparison to the complexity of monolithic architectures.
#### Scalability: Since microservices are implemented and deployed independently of each other, i.e. they run within independent processes, they can be monitored and scaled independently.
#### Integration of heterogeneous and legacy systems: microservices is considered as a viable means for modernizing existing monolithic software application. There are experience reports of several companies who have successfully replaced (parts of) their existing software by microservices, or are in the process of doing so. The process for Software modernization of legacy applications is done using an incremental approach.
#### Distributed development: it parallelizes development by enabling small autonomous teams to develop, deploy and scale their respective services independently. It also allows the architecture of an individual service to emerge through continuous refactoring. Microservice-based architectures facilitate continuous integration, continuous delivery and deployment.
